Here are some terms to get familiar with, before we dive into making a website.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language
--------------------------------

HTML is the main markup language for creating web pages and other
information that can be displayed in a web browser. You can write your
web application in any programming languages, but in the end it will
always be transformed into HTML because that’s the language of the
browser. It is a hierarchical language.

A short bit of history
----------------------

HTML was developed at the CERN in Switzerland. Its inventor is Tim
Berners-Lee. In 1980 he wrote his first hypertext system for personal
use - the predecessor of HTML. With the first browser and server
software the very young internet and HTML made their way to conquer
the world. In 1992 two copies of a free web browser were downloaded
from a computer at CERN to a computer in the USA. In 1995 the first
Internet Explorer was published.

How about HTML5? What’s that?
-----------------------------

This is just the latest version of HTML. There is a lot of interest
about it, because it improves and adds many HTML elements, making it
easier to write and to use.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
----------------------------

CSS is a language used for describing the look and formatting of a
document written in a markup language. It is closely connected with
HTML, since it gives style to HTML elements. In contrast to HTML, CSS
has no hierarchy and can be written in the order that we choose.

**CSS3** is the last released version of CSS, and it also improves CSS a
lot. For example, it gives the possibility to animate an element.
