Welcome
=======

Welcome to OpenTechSchool's HTML & CSS workshop! This course is a
simple and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML
and CSS.

What we’ll do today
-------------------

Today we will learn how to write a web page with HTML and style it with
CSS. Our goal is to create a personal portfolio page with a presentation
and contact page.

Once you are done with your personal portfolio, you can explore some
interesting links that you can find below the “Extra” section. If you’re
extra curious once you are done with the portfolio, these resources will
help you to keep coding with HTML and CSS or just keep you updated about
what’s next.
